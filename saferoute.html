<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>My first interaction design project started with ambigiuous constraints : Find any issue in a near by community and apply user centered design process to solve it.</p>
  <p>It was my first week in Ann Arbor and navigating the town hadn't been that easy. Seeing the crime alert emails I realized concerns around safety led to a news headline every other day.
  So I decided to look at the quantitative data and apply various qualitative data gathering methods to learn more about
    target audience in this context.
 </p>


<h3>Solution Overview</h3>
<p>The solution concentrates on features that pivots on the target audience’s critical concerns on safety while traveling alone. Post interviews, brainstorming and persona creation I have narrowed down on making a mobile app ‘SafeRoute’ which will encourage safer travels by providing necessary information in a non-overwhelming way and give the right amount of flexibility to choose your routes. The following sections will detail on these key features.

<h3>The Design Process</h3>
<p>At every step of the design process, my overarching question has been “Will this work in a real world scenario?” To answer this I needed to follow a structured process and gather enough information to justify my design decisions. To keep things all in one place I created a virtual design notebook in Evernote. Here I kept snaps from dribble, articles from Medium, links from my online research on the problem statement and target audience I chose.
   Through the semester I kept adding and assessing what additions I had and followed the structure of Dan Saffer’s design Strategy. Highlights from my design process could be diagrammatically represented as:

<h3 id="research">Research</h3>

<p>
My initial problem statement was a result of my personal experiences during my first month in  Ann Arbor. But was this a real problem? I did an intensive amount of “Online Research” to gather facts and numbers. Then I conducted user interviews to see what the target audience in AA felt.
<img src="./images/interviewdata.png">
Their major concern for safety was not really that there was a lack of streetlights in many areas but more on of the unfamiliarity of those routes.
</p>
<blockquote>Having company isn’t really necessary for me to feel safe
I am more scared of large crowds, especially groups of drunk people on the streets.</blockquote>

<h3 id="observations">Observations and Analysis</h3>
<p>Traveling at late hours from Central and North Campus I observed around 7-10 people of different age groups. Most people walked alone from the bus stop to their apartments, not paying attention much to the environment but rather to their smartphones. Competitive analysis and usability reports of available solutions like Waze, Google maps, Redzone etc. helped me filter out key design and functional ideas.
</p>

<h3 id="ideation">Ideation</h3>
<p>I started off by sketching and brainstorming some diverse solutions. My aim was to look for varied solutions from glow in the dark streets to drones which could give you company while traveling. Once I started storyboarding I could imagine a user journey and it helped me understand if my solution was really making an impact. As we learned in this course the importance of brainstorming, I truly understood its impact when I paired with my classmates to discuss our problem statements. Even though we were solving different issues, we could see a common pattern of ideating and reiterating over multiple ideas. This also gave me an opportunity to reflect on my ideas which helped me refine the solution more.

  approaches.</p>

<p>The following are other key takeaways which were converted into features in my final solution and what lead to them:
</p>
<ul>
<li>People feel unsafe in different ways even in the scenario of just walking back home. (Information gathered from face to face interviews)</li>

<li>Not everyone wants to be involved in a community engagement activity but they do want to have updated information on their neighborhood, like areas of recent crimes , under construction roads, etc. (Information gathered from face to face interviews and Observations)</li>

<li>Users trust their family and friends more than external agencies to keep them safe. (Information gathered from face to face interviews)</li>

<li>Users want to not only get information from this App, but also have a way to share their experience. (Information gathered from face to face interviews and Personal chats post Instagram post)</li>

</ul>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Over the fall semester I developed a problem statement and solution simultaneously, which merged into a mobile app. The idea was to use a very rapid approach to usability, emphasizing small-N user testing and paper prototypes to generate user feedback before investing in anything concrete. If SafeRoute would be a successful app, it would not only help spread local knowledge within local communities but also help new residents during their initial days in a new place. The next step, is working on the feedback from the iteration #1 of the digital prototype to improve usability and correct any unintuitive designs. With new user feedback, more merits of participatory design can be explored.
