<h5>My Role: UX Designer, UX Researcher</h5>
<h6>Individual Project</h6>
<h6>Project Timeline: September 2017 - December 2017</h6>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>My first interaction design project started with ambigiuous constraints : Find any issue in a near by community and apply user centered design process to solve it.
  <p>It was my first week in Ann Arbor and navigating the town hadn't been that easy. Seeing the crime alert emails I realized concerns around safety led to a news headline every other day.
  So I decided to look at data. </p>

<p>Turns out even today 37% of adults in the U.S. say there is an area within a mile of where they live where they would be afraid to walk alone at night, similar to Americans' attitudes over the last decade and a half (Source : Gallup U.S. Daily survey Oct. 12-15, 2014). This perception of safety hasn’t changed very drastically in spite of innumerable advancements in technology.
  So I decided to structure the initial problem statement as 'Lending a hand to people walking home and improving their perception of personal safety.</p>

<p>The same Gallup Survey also highlighted that there was a both a gender and economic status gap in safety.
  Ann Arbor is 35th on the list of "Top 100 cities with highest percentage of college students" (City-Data.com).
  Hence I decided to chosen them as my target audience.
</p>

<h3>Solution Overview</h3>
<p>The solution concentrates on features that pivots on the target audience’s critical concerns on safety while traveling alone. Post interviews, brainstorming and persona creation I have narrowed down on making a mobile app ‘SafeRoute’ which will encourage safer travels by providing necessary information in a non-overwhelming way and give the right amount of flexibility to choose your routes. The following sections will detail on these key features.

<h3>The Design Process</h3>
<p>At every step of the design process, my overarching question has been “Will this work in a real world scenario?” To answer this I needed to follow a structured process and gather enough information to justify my design decisions. To keep things all in one place I created a virtual design notebook in Evernote. Here I kept snaps from dribble, articles from Medium, links from my online research on the problem statement and target audience I chose.
   Through the semester I kept adding and assessing what additions I had and followed the structure of Dan Saffer’s design Strategy. My design process could be diagrammatically represented as:

<h3 id="research">Research</h3>

<p>
My problem statement was a result of my personal experiences during my first month in  Ann Arbor. But was this a real problem? I did an intensive amount of “Online Research” to gather facts and numbers. Next I talked to a total of 8 people: 4 women (graduate or PhD students)  and 4 men (graduate and part time students). Out of these 8 people, 6 of them have moved to AA in the last 3 months and the other two have been here for more than a year and a half but none of them own a vehicle. They usually take the Ride or Blue Bus and then walk home from the bus stop. Their busy and diverse schedule doesn’t really make it easy to coordinate and travel with other people. Only 2 out the 8 people said they would be interested in any kind of a community engagement activity but at the same time they do want to know about the neighborhood they live in. Their major concern for safety was not really that there was a lack of streetlights in many areas but more on of the unfamiliarity of those routes. One interviewee mentioned that having company isn’t really necessary for him to feel safe. He is rather scared of large crowds, especially groups of drunk people on the streets. This was a scenario I hadn’t considered before. On doing some for research, I was able to confirm that increased frequency of assaults around bars are very true.

In class I had also discussed my solutions with my peers and had gotten a very positive reply for a Walk- me home robot. When I looked at the backgrounds of the interviewees I realized people in fields of design or computer science believed that futuristic solutions like a robot could actually help the society. To quickly get an overall view of a larger group of people (whose educational background and gender  I know of) on automation and reasons for feeling unsafe I conducted a poll on Instagram. Instagram stories offer the option of posting images with a poll feature which is available for a day to the people following me. Each question was accompanied by an image too. The results were collected at the end of 24hrs, which helped me narrow down the solution to a mobile app and some of its critical features too.
</p>

<h3 id="observations">Observations and Analysis</h3>
<p>Traveling at late hours from Central and North Campus I observed around 7-10 people of different age groups. Most people walked alone from the bus stop to their apartments, not paying attention much to the environment but rather to their smartphones. Competitive analysis and usability reports of available solutions like Waze, Google maps, Redzone etc. helped me filter out key design and functional ideas.

<h3 id="ideation">Ideation</h3>
<p>I started off by sketching and brainstorming some diverse solutions. My aim was to look for varied solutions from glow in the dark streets to drones which could give you company while traveling. Once I started storyboarding I could imagine a user journey and it helped me understand if my solution was really making an impact. As we learned in this course the importance of brainstorming, I truly understood its impact when I paired with my classmates to discuss our problem statements. Even though we were solving different issues, we could see a common pattern of ideating and reiterating over multiple ideas. This also gave me an opportunity to reflect on my ideas which helped me refine the solution more.
</p>

<h3>Design Principles</h3>
<p>With all these ideas to choose from and data from user interviews to refer back at,  I needed to define my design principles to help me pick the appropriate solution.
<ul>
<li>To know who my users were I created 4 different personas, this helped to choose my primary target audience, i.e. University Students who don't own vehicles.</li>

<li>From the user research and the interviews I conducted with these students, I learned that people care about traveling safely but do not always have the time to do safety assessments of the routes they take. Incoming students do want to know their neighborhood more but do not necessarily have the time or means to do this.</li>

<li>"Whenever I receive a crime alert email, I immediately check the location to see if I am far enough from it. These repeated mails make me anxious about the neighborhood I am and affect my perception of safety". - Interviewee. Hence the solutions must provide safety information in a planned way without scaring the users more.</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h3 id="Refinement">Refinements</h3>
<p>The process of refinement started rigorously with the QOC Analysis.</p>

<div>
<img src="" alt="qoc">
</div>
<br>


<p>One specific conclusion that stood out to me was that people have different ways of determining their safety, which is driven by multiple things. This has helped me change my problem statement a bit to consider more than one concern for a safe neighborhood. For example, users prefer choosing an unfamiliar road over a busy street with a bunch of drunk people, but an unfamiliar road over of a dark deserted road.  This shows how user preference varies with the scenario. The tool designed should consider such variations.
</p>
<p>The following are other key takeaways which were converted into features in my final solution and what lead to them:
</p>
<ul>
<li>People feel unsafe in different ways even in the scenario of just walking back home. (Information gathered from face to face interviews)</li>

<li>Not everyone wants to be involved in a community engagement activity but they do want to have updated information on their neighborhood, like areas of recent crimes , under construction roads, etc. (Information gathered from face to face interviews and Observations)</li>

<li>Users trust their family and friends more than external agencies to keep them safe. (Information gathered from face to face interviews)</li>

<li>Users want to not only get information from this App, but also have a way to share their experience. (Information gathered from face to face interviews and Personal chats post Instagram post)</li>

</ul>


<h3>Social Impact of SafeRoute</h3>
<p>By sort of combining inputs from navigation and safety apps this solution with its “super hero” users, aims to improve the perception of safety in a neighborhood and virtually engage a community of students. But with these advantages also come issues of security and privacy on online forums. Though we have a virtual community, the essence of living together in the same place cannot be felt. This form of online engagement might further distance people from each other. </p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Over the fall semester I developed a problem statement and solution simultaneously, which merged into a mobile app. The idea was to use a very rapid approach to usability, emphasizing small-N user testing and paper prototypes to generate user feedback before investing in anything concrete. If SafeRoute would be a successful app, it would not only help spread local knowledge within local communities but also help new residents during their initial days in a new place. The next step, is working on the feedback from the iteration #1 of the digital prototype to improve usability and correct any unintuitive designs. With new user feedback, more merits of participatory design can be explored.
