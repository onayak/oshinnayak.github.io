    <h1>UX Design Internship at Nutanix </h1>

<div>

  <div class="row">
  	<strong>The Challenge: </strong> Design solutions for Nutanix Prism components like Acropolis File Servers and Network Visualization. Create and modify a user research plan for an enterprise environment.
  </div>
  <div class="row">
  	<strong>The Outcome: </strong> High fidelity prototypes shared and critiqued by engineers, senior UX designers and product managers. Created multiple iterations using this feedback. Nutanix Prism Component designed is under NDA.
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <strong>Spoiler: </strong> I got to assist the complete installation of a $200,000 Nutanix node right from taking it out of a cardboard box to seeing it active on the cloud.

<h5>My Role: UX Design Intern</h5>
<h6>Team Members: <a href="http://nutanix.design/">Nutanix Design</a> </h6>
<h6>Project Timeline: January 2018 - April 2018</h6>
<hr>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

<p>I spent Summer of 2018 working as a UX Design Intern with at Nutanix, San Jose. During the three month internship I had the opportunity to explore four enterprise UX projects at different phases of the design process. Apart from work, my weeks were packed with networking events, bootcamps, and intern outings. Read ahead to know in detail about what my first UX internship experience was filled with!
</p>
<p>Note: Due to the NDA agreement instead of discussing the prototypes created or components worked on I will be focussing on the process and tools used.

<h2 id="Getting Started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>Before jumping into projects I spent the first week learning about Nutanix through
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Knowledge transfers from the team - Xi, Foundation, Alerts, AFS, and Containers
</li>
  <li> A Datacenter Visit
</li>
<li>Analysis of User Interview data
</li>
<li>Heuristic Evaluation of Nutanix Prism components
</li>
<li><a href="http://nutanixbible.com/">Nutanix Bible</a> and Medium articles
</li>
<li>Nutanix Bootcamp
</li>
</ul>
<p>These resources proved to be a very helpful source for reference throughout the internship as I kept diving deeper into individual projects. With a highlevel understanding of Nutanix Prism components I plugged myself into two ongoing projects, kickstarted a thrid one, and sprinted a fourth project during a Intern Hackathon. </p>

    </ul>


      <h2 id="user-archetypes">Creating User Archetypes</h2>
      <p>This project’s end result was changing the project itself.</p>
      <p>The design team had conducted interviews with various customers like infrastructure admins,
        network admins, and project managers. The end goal of the project at that stage was to create
        personas to help designers and stakeholders.  </p>

      <p>I took the task of analysing these interviews using Nvivo to code the transcripts.
      </p>
      <p>Overall my analysis led to one major insight: The interview script needs to be modified.</p>
      <p>In the infrasture world role or position of users and their work aren’t mapped consistently
        through the university. This led us to also consider modifying the interview scripts and the study plan itself. Instead of just interviewing customers
        we decided to talk to employees who had been in the firm for years and could shed light on issues customers faced in detail. We also updated the end goal to Creating User
        Archetypes, instead of just personas. <p>

      <h2 id="file-servers">Redesigning File Servers</h2>
      <p> To create high fidelity prototypes for Nutanix Prism components was the most challenging part of my
        internship. Specifically because I had to redesign a perfectly functional and usable component.</p>
        <p>Well then why redesign at all? </p>
        <p> Through usability tests with customers it had been clear that most users did not know much about
          how the process of creating a file sever works on Nutanix Node. With no direct competitors this wasn't a
          conventional workflow and was specific to Nutanix Prism.</p>
          <p>Goal: To help users have a clear understanding of the File server creation process so that they cab efficiently
             utilize the available resources.</p>
             <p>How did I design a new flow with visual aspects?</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Analysed the usability data from .NEXT Nice and DC for Visual flows for AFS.</li>
<li>Used maze.design to share the redesigned prototypes and collect comprehensive feedback to use for future iterations.</li>
<li>Conducted usability tests with UI engineer and a backend engineer.</li></ul>

      </div>

      <h2 id="network-visualizations">Visualize your Network</h2>
      <p>In a three day Hackathon my team and I tried to answer a common question Network admins have:
      Which node is not working? In the world of datacenter admins we learned that error dectection is a complex time consuming
      task. </p>
      <p>Mapping physical connections in a datacenter to a visual network topology would help reduce some of this complexity.
        Our proposed design used simple shapes (nodes) and red colored dots (errored link source) to indicate overall state of the datacenter. Our deign rationale
        was based on the following
    </p>
    <blockquote> To monitor a complex system where mutiple things can go wrong, an efficient error dectection
    system could be static when all systems are up. In case of an error, it could indicate it through motion,
  color, and concentrated activity in the errored region.  </blockquote>
    <blockquote> Reduce the cognitive load by displaying details in progressive manner. </blockquote>
    <p>Due to the NDA agreement the designs cannot be shared here.</p>

      <h2 id="feature-creation">Feature Creation</h2>

<p>My fourth project involved coming up with a completely new feature to improve engagement between Nutanix Prism and its users.
This involved a process of low fidelity sketches, competetive analysis ,calls with the CTO, and a lot of brainstorming. </p>
<p>The most important takeaway for me as an intern was the opportunity to explore this part of the design process, think about business goals vs design goals, and put on my creative hat.</p>
